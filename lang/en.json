                "q1": "Is Spixi secure? What security measures are implemented?",
                "a1": "Spixi is one of the most secure chat apps out there. It doesn’t rely on or use any centralised servers and your messages are stored only on your device locally. Spixi is a peer-to-peer app and it uses several layers of encryption for added security and privacy.It uses encryption algorithms such as RSA, AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305.",
                "q2": "How do payments work in Spixi?",
                "a2": "Spixi is a dAPP (decentralised app) running on the Ixian platform. It uses the Ixian Blockchain to perform IXI payments. All payments made can be verified on the Ixian Block Explorer.",
                "q3": "Can I use Spixi on multiple devices simultaneously?",
                "a3": "Because Spixi is decentralised, some features are more challenging to implement. You will be happy to know that we are working on multi-device support. Once released you will be able to use the same account across devices while still enjoying the same level of security and privacy.",
                "q4": "What happens if I forget my password?",
                "a4": "Spixi is a self-custodial wallet and dApp. This means that the password can not be retrieved in case it is lost. Be sure to create a backup and save the file, write down the password and keep it safe. It is up to you to keep your funds secure.",
                "q5": "How can I block or report a contact?",
                "a5": "Due to its nature, Spixi doesn’t have a central registry of users. When 2 users connect, before any messages can be sent, a handshake is performed where public keys are exchanged. This creates a secure connection between them. If you want to ‘block’ a user, simply remove them from your contacts. This will disable them from sending you messages. You can always decide to add them again.",
                "q6": "Does Spixi support group chats? How do I create one?",
                "a6": "Because Spixi doesn’t use central servers, group chats are a bit more challenging to add.  We are working on this and we expect to add this and other features soon.",
                "q7": "Can I create a community server on Spixi?",
                "a7": "Spixi Community Bot allows you to create a server that other Spixi users can join. You can manage users and create different channels.",
                "q8": "What file types can I send through Spixi?",
                "a8": "You can send any file you want. It is important to keep in mind that this is a direct peer-to-peer transfer and it also relies on the Ixian S2 network to deliver the files. We are constantly improving the app and the Ixian infrastructure, which will result in faster transfer times in the near future.",
                "q9": "Are my messages backed up?",
                "a9": "Your messages are stored ONLY on your device. There is no server with the backup. This is important to ensure the privacy and security of your communication. And it ensures that you and your contact are the only people who have access to the messages.",
                "q10": "Can I customize notifications in Spixi?",
                "a10": "Push notifications in Spixi are not customizable in order to protect your privacy. Because they are pushed through external servers from Apple or Google in non-encrypted form, they can easily be intercepted. To prevent leaking any private information, notifications don’t contain any user specific data such as message contents among other things.",
                "q11": "Can another Spixi user connect with me using my nickname?",
                "a11": "Nicknames are only displayed to contacts and don’t serve as handles. Your Spixi address is used to connect. Spixi does recognize IXI Names, this allows others to find you and add you using your IXI Name. To register a name you should visit <a href='https://www.ixinames.io/' target='_blank'>www.ixinames.io</a>",
                "q12": "How does Spixi handle user data?",
                "a12": "Spixi doesn’t store or share any personal data. No phone numbers, emails, history or contacts are stored anywhere else. Your account is your own.",
                "q13": "Can I delete my Spixi account permanently?",
                "a13": "You can always permanently delete your wallet and account.Because Spixi is a decentralised app, your account is stored on your device only. You are free to create backups of your account and store them yourself, but Spixi does not have any remote backup capabilities.",
                "q14": "Are there any fees associated with using Spixi?",
                "a14": "Using Spixi is free and it will always be free. Sending messages and files (up to a limit) don’t incur any costs",
                "q15": "Where can I find support if I encounter problems with Spixi?",
                "a15": "You can join the Ixian community (visit <a href='https://www.ixian.io/' target='_blank'>www.ixian.io</a> for more information on how to join) and find support from other users. Or you can write to us directly to <a href='mailto:support&commat;spixi.io'>support&commat;spixi.io</a> and we will be happy to help."
